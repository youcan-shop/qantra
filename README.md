# YouCan Qantra

YouCan Qantra is a TypeScript library that helps you embed your application inside of the YouCan Seller Area. The following documentation will guide you through the initial setup process.

> [!Note]
> Qantra components do not render within the app's component hierarchy; instead, they encapsulate TypeScript messages responsible for communication with the Seller Area. The UI rendering is handled by the Seller Area.

## YouCan UI

When working on your app, it's a good idea to use YouCan UI. This helps ensure a consistent look and feel between your app and the Seller Area. Just import the YouCan UI Vue library into your app ‚Äì it has all the components designed for the Seller Area. Check out the [documentation](https://developer.youcan.shop/youcan-ui/) to learn more about how to use the UI library.
